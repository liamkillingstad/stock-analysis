# Stock-Analysis
Module 2 Challenge involving the analysis of various green stocks.

# Green Energy Stock Analysis

## Project Overview
In this Module 2 Challange, we are assisting our friend Steve in building a dynamic excel workbook that quickly analyzes returns on a portfolio of green stocks. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the project, more specifically, was to analyze data related to green energy stocks in 2017 and 2018 and see how daily trading volume and annual returns were impacted. 

Steve is looking to do a more robust analysis for his parents. They are interested in investing in DAQO stocks. DAQO (ticker sign "DQ") is a company that makes silicon for solar panels. In order to determine the potential quality of the investment, Steve wants to run an analysis on DQ's stocks performance over the period between 2017 and 2018 in comparison to other green-energy stocks. The ultimate goal of the anaylsis will be to determine whether or not DQ stocks specfically are worth investing in relative to other green stocks in the index.

### Background
In this project we are using VBA to code and automate the analysis process for Steve. In the analysis we are using various VBA tools sucj as ***for loops***, ***conditionals***, and ***conditional formatting***. 

In our initial attempt to do data analysis for Steve, we ran VBA code that pulled data in a less than efficient manner (more to come in results section). The challenge required us to ***refactor*** the initial code to have it run more efficiently. The ultimate goal of the code refacotring is to ensure that the integrity of the code is strong, it runs as efficiently as possible in its current state, and that it contains enough descriptive text to be legible and refactorable for other analysts to contribute. 

## Results
### Stock Returns Analysis
When running the analysis. We saw that there were drastic differences in the performance of green stocks in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, green stocks saw strong annuakl returns with 10 of the 11 selected stocks generating positve returns and "DQ" specifically generating the highest overall returns (199%) of the entire basket of securities. Additionally, in 2017 there were 4 of 11 stocks (~36%) that generated over 100% returns during the year. 

2018, however, was a different story. in 2018, only 2 of the 11 stocks in the analysis were able to generate positive returns for investors. Of the 9 companies that generated negative returns, "DQ" generated the highest losses with a -64% return.
